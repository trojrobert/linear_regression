# linear regression

### Definition 
Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two (Simple Linear Regression ) or more (Multiple Linear Regression) variables — a dependent variable and independent variable(s). Linear relationship basically means that when one (or more) independent variables increases (or decreases), the dependent variable increases (or decreases) too

## Description 
---
This project intend to test the machine learning linear regression model on different dataset 

## Procedure
---
+ Importing data 
+ Data preprocessing 
+ Spliting of data into training and test set 
+ creating the Linear regression model 
+ Predicting the dependent variable for the test set
+ Comparing the predicted result with the atual result 
+ Visualizing the data 

## Programming languages used 
+ Python 
+ R
